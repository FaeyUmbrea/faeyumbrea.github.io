## Testing the Blog~

Hi I'm Faey. 
I'm a Unity Developer, Game Designer and Writer. Currently I'm working on a D&D 5e Setting Module called Illumhyr. It's a diverse, science fantasy setting which focuses on elements of exploration and cosmic horror and comes with a host of deep, dark secrets for players to explore.
